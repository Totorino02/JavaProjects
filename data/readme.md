##### **EXPLANATIONS**
###### why **_`StringBuilder`_** than **_`String`_**
    String is immutable it mean that when you try to add a new char[]
    to an exiting, the oldest is overwrite...But StringBuilder is mutable.
    the use of StringBuilder help us to improve preformances.

######  **_`StringTokenizer`_** than **_`String.split()`_**
    The simple reason is instead of using String we use StringBuilder
